# CS-CO
CS-CO is a hybrid self-supervised visual representation learning method tailored for H&E-stained histopathological images. This work has been presented in MICCAI2021 conference as an oral talk.

# Instructions
We provide detailed step-by-step instructions for reproducing experiments of the proposed method on NCT-CRC-HE-100K. You can also run the proposed method on your own dataset in a similar way.

**Step 1** Prepare the dataset.

Please download the dataset from [NCT-CRC-HE-100K](https://zenodo.org/record/1214456#.Yn9lVy8RrfY). In our paper, NCT-CRC-HE-100K.zip is used as the training set and CRC-VAL-HE-7K.zip is used as the test set. For each set, we exclude images belonging to "BACK" class and move the rest images to one folder. 

```
____NCT-CRC
    |____train
         |____patches
              |____aaa.png
              |____bbb.png
              |____ccc.png
    |____test
         |____patches
              |____ddd.png
              |____eee.png
              |____fff.png
```

Then, please get into `./data_preprocess/` and do stain separation on training and test set separately by running:

```
python H_H_prime_generate.py
```

**Step 2** Train the model.
The training of the proposed CS-CO contains two stages. Please get into `./train/`

At the first stage, cross-stain prediction can be done by running:

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python3 -u 4_csco_train.py configs/NCT_CRC/cs_conf_resnet18.ini 
```

At the second stage, contrastive learning can be done by running:

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2 python3 -u 4_csco_train_dist.py configs/NCT_CRC/cs-co_conf_resnet18.ini 3
```

**Step 3** Test the model.


```
python3 
```
