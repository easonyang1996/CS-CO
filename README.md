# Instructions
We provide detailed step-by-step instructions for reproducing experiments of the proposed method on NCT-CRC-HE-100K. You can also run the proposed method on your own dataset in a similar way.

**Step 1** Prepare the dataset.
Please download the dataset from [NCT-CRC-HE-100K](https://zenodo.org/record/1214456#.Yn9lVy8RrfY). NCT-CRC-HE-100K.zip is used as training set and CRC-VAL-HE-7K.zip is used as test set. As mentioned in our paper, we drop images belonging to "BACK" class.


**Step 2** Train the model.


```
python3 
```

**Step 3** Test the model.


```
python3 
```
